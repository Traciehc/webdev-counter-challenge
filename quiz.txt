1. Why do you use "using strict" at the top of your JS files?

    Because it changes the behavior of JavaScript and helps you write cleaner and more error free code.

2. What does line 3 mean?

    It means you declared the variable count and assigned 
    it the value of 0.

3. What is happening on lines 5-8 and why?

    These lines are selecting and storing references to specific elements in the HTML, 
    the reason for that is so that you can use these elements later in javascript by
     manipulating them such as in the instance of adding event listeners as needed in 
     response to user interactions.

4. If you implemented the functionality of the buttons,
   why do you think I wrote the JS code the way I did?

   Probably to make me question why it is not functioning.  It is not functioning because the 
   eventListeners are inside of other eventListeners and need to be outside of the function to work.
   Other than that I really don't have a clue.  
  
  
   Also, I would be the first to admit that I have been having some trouble with the @media query.
   The problem is with my understanding it and I am hoping that by playing around with them that it
   will eventually click for me.

   Thanks for all that you do, I hope you have a great Thanksgiving!
